                        The basic philosophy of AKGEC towards all processes and activities is oriented towards environmental sustenance and eco friendliness. The architecture, design and construction of college building  is such that bricks and stones are used maximum and cement plastering is minimal which makes it maintenance free. The architecture of buildings ensures maximum sunlight on all floors. This allows high circulation of natural air and green plantations to flourish inside and outside buildings.  The buildings are thermally insulated which keeps the temperature lower in summers and higher in winters, thereby reducing the need for power consumption. 
 

                        Each block and building is surrounded by large open areas on which green lawns, hedges and planters maintain a healthy balance with environment.
                        
                        
                        A network of rain harvesting systems ensure continuous recharging of ground water table. The sewage treatment plant recycles the water filtered through its beds for use of horticulture, green lawns, hedges and plantations of college.
                        
                        
                        There is high focus on conservation of natural resources. Automatic water dispensers are used in toilets / urinals to avoid continuous running of water and ensure its usage when needed.  
                        
                        
                        Conservation of electricity is ensured by its usage only when and where needed. Slowly a culture has been built amongst faculty and staff to put off appliances, lights and fans when they leave office. Conservation of electricity is also ensured by use of solar water heaters for providing hot water in all the 6 hostels of the college.  A roof top solar power plant of 330 KW capacity has been installed in college campus. This power plant is linked with the electric grid of electricity department where surplus power generated is fed back through a meter installed for this purpose. 
                        
                        
                        Conservation of fossil fuels is ensured by making special efforts to co-ordinate and club various trips of vehicles required by different departments and their usage optimised. 
                        
                        
                        The waste management area is given high priority. The recyclable garbage waste and non recyclable wastes are dumped in specified containers / dustbins. A separate agency with specialised expertise and dealing in waste collection and disposal has been hired to collect the wastes on daily basis. This company processes the bi-degradable waste to make manure and dispose off cyclable & non-cyclable wastes as per established norms of Government.  
                        
                        Optimum usage of natural resources used by mankind is the
                         basic need of the day to maintain required balance in nature
                        This theme is our mantra.
